# Steps to Contribute Code to This Repository

## Step 1: Navigate to the Appropriate Language Folder
- First, enter the folder that corresponds to the programming language you are using.

## Step 2: Check for Your Topic
- Within the language folder, check if there is a folder related to your topic. If it's not present, create a new folder dedicated to your topic.

## Step 3: Choose the Specific Question
- Inside the topic folder, choose the specific question you want to contribute a solution for.

## Step 4: Add Your Solution
- If there's no existing solution for your question, create a new file with the name of your question. Use a format like `question_name.ext`, where "ext" represents the file extension for your chosen programming language.

## Step 5: Provide Your Code
- If there's already a solution, but you have a different approach, add a comment like "Another Approach" and then paste your code below the existing solution.

These steps ensure that the repository remains organized and makes it easy for contributors to find the relevant folders and questions for their contributions. It also encourages collaboration and the sharing of alternative solutions.
